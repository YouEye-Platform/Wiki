# YouEye Wiki

Privacy-friendly article reader for the [YouEye](https://github.com/YouEye-Platform/YouEye) platform.

Wiki runs as a native YouEye app. It is installed by the Control Panel from GitHub releases, receives identity and launch context from YouEye, and exposes dashboard, settings, and notification surfaces back to the platform.

Current development source version: `0.4.4.1.0.2`

## Features

- Article browsing with clean reading layouts
- Search and featured article surfaces
- Reading-focused dashboard widgets
- App-owned settings panel for YouEye Settings
- Notification surface for rich app notifications
- Theme, language, and account menu integration
- PWA-ready build with service worker assets

## YouEye Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Main Wiki app |
| `/embed/widget/featured-article` | Dashboard featured article widget |
| `/embed/widget/today-in-history` | Dashboard history widget |
| `/embed/settings` | App settings panel shown inside YouEye Settings |
| `/embed/notification/default` | Rich notification body |
| `/api/manifest` | Native app manifest consumed by Market and UI |
| `/api/health` | Container health and version endpoint |

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app uses Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the shared native-app surface contract used by YouEye apps.

## Build and release checks

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm release:check
pnpm build
```

The source-owned `.youeye/build/app` entrypoint produces an unsigned
`standalone.tar` for independent validation, signing, and publication. It
requires the build environment described in `.youeye/build/manifest.json`.
Package and install-manifest versions must agree. Development tags use
`dev-v<version>`; Stable tags use `v<version>`.

The install manifest retains the Forgejo source identity. The public project
website is documentation metadata, not an instruction to switch update sources.
See [PUBLIC_RELEASE_POLICY.md](PUBLIC_RELEASE_POLICY.md) for publication rules.
